The `pages/` directory is optional, meaning that if you only use [app.vue](/docs/directory-structure/app), vue-router won't be included, reducing your application bundle size.

# Pages directory

Nuxt will automatically integrate [Vue Router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/) and map `pages/` directory into the routes of your application.

::alert{type=warning}
Unlike components, your pages must have a single root element to allow Nuxt to apply route transitions between pages.

## Dynamic Routes

If you place anything within square brackets, it will be turned into a [dynamic route](https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/dynamic-matching.html) parameter. You can mix and match multiple parameters and even non-dynamic text within a file name or directory.

If you need a catch-all route, you create it by using a file named like `[...slug].vue`. This will match _all_ routes under that path, and thus it doesn't support any non-dynamic text.

### Example

```bash
-| pages/
---| index.vue
---| users-[group]/
-----| [id].vue
```

Given the example above, you can access group/id within your component via the `$route` object:

```vue
<template>
  {{ $route.params.group }}
  {{ $route.params.id }}
</template>
```

## Nested Routes

If you need to display the child component of a [nested route](https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/nested-routes.html), use the `NuxtChild` component (a semantic alias for `NuxtPage` using `RouterView` under the hood).

### Example

```bash
-| pages/
---| parent/
------| child.vue
---| parent.vue
```

The file tree above should generate these routes:

```ts
[
  {
    path: '/parent',
    component: '~/pages/parent.vue',
    name: 'parent',
    children: [
      {
        path: 'child',
        component: '~/pages/parent/child.vue',
        name: 'parent-child'
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

To display the `child.vue` component, you should use the `<NuxtChild>` component inside `parent.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>parent.vue</h1>
    <NuxtChild />
  </div>
</template>
```
