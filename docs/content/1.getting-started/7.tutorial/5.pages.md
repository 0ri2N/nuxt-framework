# Create pages and link them together

In this section, you will learn about:

- Nuxt file-based routing
- Using dynamic parameters in routes
- Linking pages together with the `NuxtLink` component

# Pages directory

One of Nuxt core feature is the file-system router. Every Vue file created inside the `pages/` directory will create a corresponding URL (or **route**) that displays the content of the file.

[Diagram]

For now, we only worked in the `app.vue` file. To create more routes, we need to first change it a bit. `app.vue` will become the shell that displays the content of every page.

Create a `pages/` directory at the root of the project, and move the `<template>` and `<script>` block of `app.vue` in `pages/index.vue`.

[SNIPPET]

In `app.vue` , replace the previous `<template>` block by these lines:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <main class="container">
  <h1>Mountains Explorer</h1>
    <NuxtPage/>
  </main>
</template>
```

NuxtPage is a special component provided by Nuxt to display the content of the current page. If you use Vue Router, you can think of it as the `<RouterView />` component.

The page displayed at the `/` route now comes from the `index.vue` file in the `pages/` directory. The `index.vue` file is a **convention**. We could create a `/about` route by naming a file `about.vue` in `pages/` :

```vue [pages/about.vue]
<template>
 <section>
  <h1>About mountains</h1>
  <p>.....</p>
 </section>
</template> 
```

If you navigate to [/about](http://localhost:3000/about) you should see the page displayed.

::alert{type=info icon=ðŸ’¡}
Under the hood, Nuxt generates the vue-router configuration file with every components created in the pages directory, based on their file name.

# Dynamic routes

The `/about` page we created is a **static** route: it will always display the same information. Sometimes, what we need is a **template** that will display different content in the same way: think about blog posts or shop articles. We donâ€™t want to create a file for each item, but rather tell Nuxt to use the same template for every post: a **dynamic** route.

To create a dedicated page for each of the mountains of our website, create a file named `[mountain].vue`  in the `pages/` directory. The brackets `[]` notation is a **placeholder** informing Nuxt that this route will be dynamic. Copy this snippet in the file:

```vue [pages/[mountain].vue]
<template>
 <section>
  <h1>
   {{ $route.params.mountain }}
  </h1>
  <img :src="`/images/${$route.params.mountain}.png`" :alt="$route.params.mountain" />
 </section>
</template>
```

If you navigate to [/everest](http://localhost:3000/everest), you should see the URL parameter value: `everest` displayed in the `h1` tag, and the Everest illustration. Try to replace /everest with another of the mountains name in the browserâ€™s address bar and refresh.

The value of the parameter is available with the `$route.params` object from vue-router. As our filename is `[mountain].vue` , the parameterâ€™s name is `mountain`.

# Nuxt Link

A multi-page website is not very useful if there are no links between pages. Nuxt uses another built-in component to link pages together: `NuxtLink`

Contrary to the `<a href="">` HTML tag, `NuxtLink` will handle navigation **client-side**, unless Javascript is disabled in the userâ€™s browser. In that case, it behaves like a traditional `<a href="">` tag. This allows to keep the benefits of a snappy client-side navigation, and other performances optimizations such as pre-fetching.

Modify the `Card.vue` component so that we can navigate by clicking on the mountains cards:

```vue [components/Card.vue]
<template>
 <article>
  <header>
   <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
  </header>
    <NuxtLink :to="`/${title}`">
      <img :src="image" :alt="description" />
    </NuxtLink>
 </article>
</template>
```

When clicking on a card, the navigation happens **client-side**, without having to reload the page.

# Summary

Nuxt uses a file-based routing system that uses the `.vue` files in the `pages/` directory to generate the **routes** of your application. These routes can either be:

- static: their content wonâ€™t be dependant of a URL parameter.
- dynamic: they use parameters and determine what to display depending on theses parameters.

The `NuxtLink` component is used to link pages between them. It allows a full client-side navigation and optimizations, and will fallback to a classic `a` tag if the browser doesnâ€™t executes the applicationâ€™s Javascript.
