# Display images and style your website

In this section, you will learn about:

- Adding static assets like images
- Adding assets processed by build tools like stylesheets

# Public directory

Every file in the `public/` directory will be served by Nuxt at the root of your application. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/images/everest.png). The displayed image is located on the `public/images` directory.

In your code, you can then reference these files relative to the root (`/`):

```html
<img src="/images/everest.png" alt="Mount Everest" />
```

Modify the `Card.vue`component to display our images:

::code-group

```vue [Composition API]
<template>
 <article>
  <header>
   <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
  </header>
   <img :src="image" :alt="description" />
 </article>
</template>

<script setup>
defineProps({
  title: String,
  image: String,
  description: String
})
</script>
```

```vue [Options API]
<template>
 <article>
  <header>
   <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
  </header>
   <img :src="image" :alt="description" />
 </article>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    props: {
      title: String,
      image: String,
      description: String
    }
  }
</script>
```

::

We can now pass the images source and description from `app.vue` :

::code-group

```vue [Composition API]
<template>
  <main>
    <h1>Mountains explorer</h1>
    <section class="grid">
      <Card
        v-for="{ name, image, description } in mountains"
        :key="name"
        :title="name"
        :image="image"
        :description="description"
      />
    </section>
  </main>
</template>

<script setup>
const mountains = [
  {
    name: 'Everest',
    image: '/images/everest.png',
    description: 'Everest is the highest mountain in the world.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Aconcagua',
    image: '/images/aconcagua.png',
    description: 'Aconcagua is the highest mountain in the world.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Denali',
    image: '/images/denali.png',
    description: 'Denali is the highest mountain in the world.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Mont Blanc',
    image: '/images/mont-blanc.png',
    description: 'Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in the world.'
  }
];
</script>
```

```vue [Options API]
<template>
  <main>
    <h1>Mountains explorer</h1>
    <section class="grid">
      <Card
        v-for="{ name, image, description } in mountains"
        :key="name"
        :title="name"
        :image="image"
        :description="description"
      />
    </section>
  </main>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data(){
    return {
      mountains: [
        {
          name: 'Everest',
          image: '/images/everest.png',
          description: 'Everest is the highest mountain in the world.'
        },
        {
          name: 'Aconcagua',
          image: '/images/aconcagua.png',
          description: 'Aconcagua is the highest mountain in the world.'
        },
        {
          name: 'Denali',
          image: '/images/denali.png',
          description: 'Denali is the highest mountain in the world.'
        },
        {
          name: 'Mont Blanc',
          image: '/images/mont-blanc.png',
          description: 'Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in the world.'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

# Assets directory

The `assets/` directory is used for stylesheets, fonts, and other files referenced in your application that Webpack or Vite will process at build time. For example, the build step will minify CSS files.

While we could write the whole application’s CSS in the `<style>` block of `app.vue`, we often need global styles for layouts and typography. They can be written in the `assets` directory and imported in the `style` block of `app.vue` like we do:

```html
<style>
 @import '/assets/style.css';
</style>
```

# Summary

The `public/` directory contains **static files** that can be directly served in production, such as `robots.txt` or images that don’t need further transformation.

The `assets/` directory contains files that can be referenced in your source-code and can be transformed by a build tool, for example stylesheets that will be minified for production.
