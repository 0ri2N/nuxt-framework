# Fetch and display data from remote sources

In this section, you will learn about:

- Using Nuxt `useAsyncData`
- The Nuxt payload object
- Fetching remote data from an API

# Data fetching

In most cases, the content of a Nuxt application is not hard-coded in Javascript or Vue source files. Content is stored in databases or written in a proper syntax like Markdown and accessed through APIs.

Nuxt provides helpers to fetch remote data, handle loading state, and reduce the number of requests for performance optimization.

We will replace the content of our application with a call to an external API that will return the data, and display them in our pages.

# useAsyncData

Within your pages and components you can use theÂ `useAsyncData` composableÂ to get access to data that resolves asynchronously, such as an external API.

::alert{type=info icon=ðŸ’¡}
Nuxt auto-imports `useAsyncData`, you donâ€™t have to manually import it.

We will first use `useAsyncData` to return our local data:

```vue
<script setup>
 const getMountains = () => {
    return [
      {
        name: 'Everest',
        image: '/images/everest.png',
        description: 'Everest is the highest mountain in the world.'
      },
      {
        name: 'Aconcagua',
        image: '/images/aconcagua.png',
        description: 'Aconcagua is the highest mountain in the world.'
      },
      {
        name: 'Denali',
        image: '/images/denali.png',
        description: 'Denali is the highest mountain in the world.'
      },
      {
        name: 'Mont Blanc',
        image: '/images/mont-blanc.png',
        description: 'Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in the world.'
      }
    ]
  }

 const { data: mountains } = useAsyncData('mountains', getMountains)
</script>
```

`useAsyncData` is a function that takes 3 arguments:

- **key**: A unique key to ensure that data fetching can be properly de-duplicated across requests.
- **fn:**Â a function that returns data (here we created a `getMountains` function that returns an array). This function can be asynchronous.
- **options**: an optional options parameter that we wonâ€™t cover in this tutorial

`useAsyncData` returns an object with 4 properties: `data, pending, error, refresh`. In this section, we are only interested in the `data` key, that we rename to `mountains` to be more explicit in our template.

# The Nuxt payload

For now, using `useAsyncData` didnâ€™t change anything, as we just wrapped our local data with the composable. But if you refresh the homepage and take a look at the generated HTML in the **elements** panel of the browserâ€™s devtools, you will notice a `script` tag assigning a `__NUXT__` property to the window object, containing our data.

```js
window.__NUXT__={data:{
  mountains:[{name:"Everest" (...)}]},
  state:{},
  _errors:{},
  serverRendered:true,
  config:{(...)}
}}
```

This is called the **payload**. The payload contains data fetched with Nuxt utilities like `useAsyncData` as well as other informations like configuration.

The `mountains` key corresponds to the `key` parameter we passed to `useAsyncData`.

Since a traditional Nuxt application is rendered on the server, the payload ensures that the browser doesnâ€™t have to make another call to get the data it needs to make the page interactive.

::alert{type=info icon=ðŸ’¡}
Did you notice the `serverRendered: true` entry? This confirms that the server generated this page when refreshing the browser window.
::

# Fetching remote data from an API

We will use the `$fetch` utility to make a request to [https://api.nuxtjs.org/mountains](https://api.nuxtjs.dev/mountains) and replace the static data we were working with until now. The `$fetch` utility will make HTTP requests to the API. `$fetch` is auto-imported like `useAsyncData`.

In `app.vue`, replace the `getMountains` function we wrote before:

```vue
<script setup>
 const getMountains = () => $fetch('https://api.nuxtjs.dev/mountains')

 const { data: mountains } = useAsyncData('mountains', getMountains)
</script>
```

The data of our homepage now comes from a remote API. The last step is to fetch the details of a mountain in the `[mountain].vue`  page:

```vue
<template>
 <section>
  <h1>
   {{ mountain.title}}
  </h1>
  <img :src="`/images/${$route.params.mountain}.png`" :alt="$route.params.mountain" />
    <p>
      {{ mountain.description }}
    </p>
 </section>
</template>

<script setup>
  const getMountain = () => $fetch(`https://api.nuxtjs.dev/mountains/${$route.params.mountain}`)

 const { data: mountain } = useAsyncData('mountains', getMountain)
</script>
```

The API URL passed to `$fetch` uses `$route.params.mountain` to only fetch the relevant data.

# Summary

The `useAsyncData` composable allows asynchronous data fetching, and ensures that Nuxt only makes necessary API calls by using the **payload** object when the server generates the pageâ€™s HTML.
